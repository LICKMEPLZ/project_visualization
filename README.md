# Heart Disease Project
## Abstract
----------------
Our project's goal was to classify the different patients to see if they have a heart
disease or not. Using machine learning, we identified the differences between a heart disease
patient and a normal patient to further classify other patients if they are positive or negative of a heart disease.


## Main

The dataset we used consisted of 1025 patients. Out of these 1025 patients, 
we checked the balance between the positive and negative patients of heart disease and got these results.

Before we graphed out our patient's age, we predicted that people of old age over their 60s will consist of more positive patients. But after we have realized that the patients of around age of 50 had the greatest number of positive heart disease patients.
