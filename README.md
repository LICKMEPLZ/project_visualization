# Heart Disease Project
## Abstract
----------------
Our project's goal was to classify the different patients to see if they have a heart
disease or not. Using machine learning, we identified the differences between a heart disease
patient and a normal patient to further classify other patients if they are positive or negative of a heart disease.

we checked the balance between the positive and negative patients of heart disease and got these results.
